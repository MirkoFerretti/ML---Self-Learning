Hello! My name is Mirko and I'm currently learning Data Science and Machine Learning. 
I like learning by doing, so I will be reading books and creating small and simple projects to put my knowledge in writing.
I will be uploading my projects here, so take a look if you're interested or if you think they might help you.
There still is a lot I don't know, so I will eventually expand my knowledge and create even bigger projects.
Have a great day :)

So far I have uploaded:
* A simple color recognition program
* A Kaggle Playground Series competition, which is Binary classification with a bank churn dataset.
* A simple recommender system
